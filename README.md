Statistics and Trends Assignment @HERTFORDSHIRE
üìä Statistics and Trends Analysis Project
Overview
This project demonstrates data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scipy.
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, and the project showcases data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and creation of meaningful plots for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

This assignment is structured according to good coding practices and aims to follow the PEP-8 guidelines.

üíª Files Included
statistics_and_trends.py: Main script containing functions for preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

data.csv: CSV file (Titanic dataset) used for analysis.

relational_plot.png: Scatter plot of Age vs. Fare by Class.

categorical_plot.png: Bar chart of Passenger Count by Class.

statistical_plot.png: Correlation heatmap of numerical attributes.

requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.

.gitignore: Standard exclusions for Python projects.

üéØ Functionalities
1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing
Shows basic descriptive statistics (df.describe()).

Displays the first few rows (df.head()).

Calculates correlation between numeric columns.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizations
Relational Plot: Scatter plot of Age vs. Fare colored by Class.

Categorical Plot: Bar plot of passenger counts by Class.

Statistical Plot: Heatmap showing correlations between numeric variables.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Analysis
Calculates four statistical moments for a selected column (fare):

Mean

Standard deviation

Skewness

Excess kurtosis

Classifies the distribution based on skewness and kurtosis:

Skewness: Left, Right, or Not Skewed

Kurtosis: Leptokurtic, Platykurtic, or Mesokurtic

üìö Project Purpose
This project was created for the Statistics and Trends assignment in the Python for Data Science, AI & Development course to demonstrate real-world data analysis techniques, including data wrangling, visualization, and descriptive statistics.
